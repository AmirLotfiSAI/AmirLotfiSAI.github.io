This study addresses the challenge of slow experimental testing for corrosion-resistant magnesium (Mg) alloys by developing a robust machine learning (ML) model. Its effectiveness is demonstrated on a comprehensive dataset aggregated from the literature. Twelve different ML algorithms were evaluated, with a custom-weighted Voting Regressor demonstrating the highest predictive accuracy. The final model achieved a coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.892 on the unseen test data. This accurate and validated model serves as a powerful tool for the rapid in silico screening of novel alloy compositions, enabling a more efficient, data-driven approach to designing the next generation of high-performance magnesium alloys.
