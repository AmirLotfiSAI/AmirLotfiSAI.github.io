I am a recent graduate of the Master's program in Materials Science and Engineering from Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST). My academic work has been centered at the exciting intersection of traditional materials science and cutting-edge artificial intelligence.

My work addresses a key bottleneck in the field: the scarcity of well-structured data. I designed and implemented a complete data-driven pipeline, which involved aggregating and rigorously preprocessing a comprehensive dataset from over 30 peer-reviewed articles. By systematically evaluating twelve different algorithms, I engineered a custom-weighted ensemble model that demonstrated superior performance.

I am actively seeking PhD opportunities in Computational Materials Science or a related field where I can apply my skills in predictive modeling to solve significant scientific challenges.

## Research Interests
* Materials Informatics and Data-Driven Discovery
* Predictive Modeling of Mechanical Properties and Corrosion Behavior
* Feature Engineering & Importance Analysis
* Ensemble Learning & Hybrid AI Models
* Computational Materials Design and Simulation

## Featured Projects
My master's research project focused on creating a robust, validated model for the rapid screening of novel alloy compositions, shifting the paradigm from slow experimental testing to efficient, data-driven prediction.
