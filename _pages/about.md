I am a recent graduate of the Master's program in Materials Science and Engineering from Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST). My academic work has been centered at the exciting intersection of traditional materials science and cutting-edge artificial intelligence.

My research focuses on Materials Informatics, where I apply machine learning and deep learning models to accelerate the discovery of novel materials. I am passionate about using data-driven approaches to predict material properties, which can drastically reduce the time and cost of experimental research.

I am actively seeking PhD opportunities in Computational Materials Science or a related field where I can apply my skills in predictive modeling to solve significant scientific challenges.

## Research Interests
* Materials Informatics and Data-Driven Discovery
* Predictive Modeling of Mechanical Properties
* Deep Learning for Microstructure Analysis
* Computational Materials Design and Simulation

## Featured Projects
My projects focus on the practical application of machine learning to materials science challenges. You can view my full portfolio for more details.

* **[Predicting Tensile Strength with Neural Networks](/portfolio/name-of-your-project-file-1/)**: A project where I developed a deep learning model to predict the mechanical properties of alloys based on their composition.
* **[Generative Models for Novel Microstructures](/portfolio/name-of-your-project-file-2/)**: An exploration into using GANs to design new, theoretical material microstructures.
